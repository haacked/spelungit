# Skip common false positives for Git tools
# Use: bandit -r src/ -s B101,B311,B324,B404,B603,B607
# Or update CI to include these skip flags

# B101: Test for use of assert (we use asserts in tests)
# B311: Standard pseudo-random generators (used for retry jitter, not security)
# B324: Weak MD5 hash (used for cache keys, not security)
# B404: Import subprocess (required for Git operations)
# B603: Subprocess without shell=True (safe when using fixed commands)
# B607: Starting process with partial executable path (standard to use "git")

# Note: bandit config skip doesn't seem to work reliably in all versions
# The CI should use: bandit -r src/ -s B101,B311,B324,B404,B603,B607 -f json -o bandit-report.json
